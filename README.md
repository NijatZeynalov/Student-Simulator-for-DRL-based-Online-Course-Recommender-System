# Student-Simulator-for-DRL-based-Online-Course-Recommender-System
This project aims to develop a student simulator to train and evaluate a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based online course recommender system. The simulator helps in evaluating how well the recommender system performs under various conditions such as different types of student profiles and interaction patterns.
