# Student Simulator for DRL based Online Course Recommender System
This project aims to develop a student simulator to train and evaluate a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based online course recommender system. The simulator helps in evaluating how well the recommender system performs under various conditions such as different types of student profiles and interaction patterns. 

The simulator provides a controlled setting to test various scenarios and student behaviors, which is crucial for stress-testing the recommender system without real-world unpredictability.

Execute the main.py script to run the entire workflow:

```
python main.py
```

"Edx Courses: A list of online courses on edx.org learning platform from Kaggle" has been used.
